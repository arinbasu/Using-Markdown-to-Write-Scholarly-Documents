I'd like to write a paper using markdown and see the results or push it everywhere. I have a workaround using [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) and the workaround goes like this:

1. I start with an Oveleaf document
2. Then create a git repository for this
3. Sync the git repo on my computer
4. Then, create documents as I need on my computer using Sublime-edit or Atom
5. Add citations using bibtex and create a bibtex file for this
6. Use pandoc to convert the markdown file to latex file
7. Push the latex file and the images and the bibliography file to Overleaf
8. Overleaf has rich text editing functions that helps me to edit the document and push everywhere
9. Also, if I write using markdown in a format say using Ulyssses, I can write using Ulysses and push it as markown then latex

This system works well. What would be terrific would be to develop a system where everything gets worked out using Markdown alone and push things around. So, in other words, rather than off and on pushing through the markdown editor on the compuer and remotely, if there could be perfect synchronicity between markdown and the final output, that would be terrific.

## Need to write tables, figures, bibliography

Advanced markdown or markdown-extra is good for writing tables, adding figures, footnotes, and also bibliography and citations from a x.bib file. 

| Points of Comparison | Overleaf* | Others such as Word |
|--------------------  |--------  |-------------------  |
| Ease of Use          | Easy     | Super easy          |
| Web Friendly         | PDF      | PDF, but not much   |
|Cloud Implementation  | Great    | Not so great        |
| Rich Text editing    | Workable | Amazing             |
| Plain Text editing   | Excellent| Not happy with it   |
| Markdown editing     | None     | None                |
| Tables               | No wysiwyg|Great Wysiwyg       |
| Bibtex               | Yes      | Um, no              |
| Figures              | Easy     | wysiwyg             |
| Layout               | Intuitive| Difficult           |
| Collaboration        | Easy     | Sharing Based       |
| Everyone uses it?    | Not sure | Yes, compatible     | 

This is a just a regular table of comparisons and by Overleaf, I mean not just Overleaf but almost everything else that look lke Overleaf (such as [Papeeria](http://www.papeeria.com), or [ShareLaTeX](http://www.sharelatex.com) and others. I mean there are some plus and minus points to this way of working. One of the things that I find myself doing increasingly is to share articles as blog posts and using html format or pushing to [Medium](http://www.medium.com). Now, medium does not have ability to display tables or html tables, and to show in Medium, tabular data need to be converted to figures and then uploaded.
